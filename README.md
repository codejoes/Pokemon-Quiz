## A challenge to create a fun and functioning quiz from scratch where users can submit their scores.

I built a Pokemon themed quiz and designed it to look sort of like the old gameboy color screen. The quiz has a functioning timer and leaderboard system.

## Usage

This webpage autoplays music unless autoplay is blocked (in that case it needs to be enabled with a little button next to the URL). To start the quiz click "Start Challenge" and your battle begins! Race the timer and finish the quiz quickly to add to your score. Finish with a perfect score to get a bonus 20 points! For now please don't click more than one answer or click the next question without submitting an answer. At the end to save your score, click the "Save Results" button. Then to view the leaderboard click "Leaderboard". Good luck!
